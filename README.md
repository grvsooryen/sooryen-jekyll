# Sooryen Website on Jekyll

To Install and run the site:
```
$ gem install jekyll bundler
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
The server would be running at [http://localhost:4000/](http://localhost:4000/).

## Thats it!

Alternatively you can go to [http://localhost:4000/admin](http://localhost:4000/admin) for little jekyll CMS.
