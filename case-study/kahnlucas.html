						<p>Kahn Lucas is a doll and clothing manufacturer for young girls and tweens. Kahn Lucas has two brands, Madame Alexander Dolls and Dollie & Me, a clothing line for girls and their dolls. Sooryen Technologies was approached by Kahn Lucas to do a total overhaul of their Madame Alexander and Dollie & Me ecommerce platforms.</p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Kahn Lucas had established separate web businesses for the two lines with duplication of personnel, effort and processes that slowed delivery, created confusion and security issues. Obvious areas for operational efficiencies were also not being capitalized on even though the two product lines used the same warehousing software and fulfillment operations.</p>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>Sooryen used Magento to solve both operational inefficiencies and security issues caused by too many users with admin access. Because Magento is such an agile ecommerce platform, Sooryen was able to integrate Kahn Lucasâ€™ existing third party warehousing solution effortlessly. Now new orders received for either product line get sent directly via EDI integration to one warehouse platform for better management and more timely fulfilment. The ultimate efficiency was achieved when we were able to reduce the number of duplicated functions and processes, saving the client money, time and facilitated better use of resources. The net result was improved productivity at Kahn Lucas.</p>
