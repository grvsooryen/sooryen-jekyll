		<h2>The Need</h2>
		<p>The Dept of Labor (DOL) was getting ready to publish its new and much anticipated rules on meeting fiduciary responsibilities as an advisor, and Cetera needed to ensure that its large network of advisors was ready for this change. According to Morningstar Financial Services Observer, October 2015, the Department of Labor’s new fiduciary rule will affect $19 billion of revenue at full-service wealth management firms. Which of Cetera’s advisors will be affected and how should Cetera develop and individualized preparedness plan for each of its advisors? To address this need, Cetera developed DOL DynamIQs™—an actionable program for adapting to this change. And the heart of this was the idea of iQuantify an online “readiness assessment” that defines individual at-risk revenue and helps the advisors prepare. Now Cetera needed a FinTech partner to implement iQuantify in short order, to get ahead of the coming change.
