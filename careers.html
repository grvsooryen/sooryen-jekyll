						Having been one of the first employees that Ram hired, I've had the unique opportunity to not only watch the company grow, but to watch my skills grow with the company. The person I was when I started here could not have imagined the person I am today. That wouldn't have happened at a lot of places, but it's almost guaranteed to happen here at Sooryen.
