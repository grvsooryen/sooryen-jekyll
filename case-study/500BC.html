			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>500 BC needed a mobile app. A mobile app that revolves around personal happiness, helping users navigate the game of life, on a smartphone. An app that would be built to run on iOS and Android in the same way so users can seamlessly switch between devices without losing their Zen. All of this to be implemented in a short time and with a limited budget. To solve this challenge, 500 BC approached Sooryen Technologies, to help navigate through the labyrinth of mobile technologies.</p>

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>When the team at Sooryen Technologies went to work at this problem, the first decision made was to go with the <a href="http://ionicframework.com/">“Ionic” </a>– framework for app development, enabling a common framework for iOS and Android development. Code once, port twice and ‘compatible by design’. Instead of building two separate native apps that needed to be kept synchronized, Sooryen used a hybrid framework that enabled us to build the 500 BC app with a small, agile and compact team. Sooryen also integrated <a href="https://www.kahuna.com/">“Kahuna“ </a>for push notifications, MySQL as a database and employed  <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/">Amazon Web Services Elastic Load Balancer</a> for distributing app traffic. Working closely with the customer, with ideation from 500 BC and technology from Sooryen, the 500 BC app was launched within the tight deadline.
