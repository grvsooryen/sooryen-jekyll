			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>To consolidate and modernize their data warehouse and analytics. Flowers was using two different analytics platforms, Neustar and Merkle, but going forward they needed to consolidate and modernize their in-house analytics. This would enable quick customer/market analytics, at their fingertips, and keep them ahead of the competition. Flowers selected Amazon Redshift as their new modern Data Warehouse solution, but now the data from two existing platforms had to be migrated over to Amazon Redshift, along with implementation of new analytics and visualization technologies.

			<h2>Solution</h2>
			<p>Flowers reached out to trusted technology partner - Sooryen Technologies to deploy the new data warehousing and analytics solution. Sooryen Technologies brought proven expertise in managing large MPP datastores, deploying Executive Dashboards, machine learning and predictive algorithms as well as Retail and Financial reporting. Sooryen technologies effectively migrated terabytes of data from both Neustar and Merkle into a single data warehouse on Amazon Redshift, enabling much faster queries and a range of analytics to be deployed on the data. Amazon Redshift is a low cost data warehousing solution specifically designed for online analytic processing (OLAP) and business intelligence (BI) applications. Once the 1-800-Flowers Data warehouse had been migrated, consolidated and modernized on Redshift, Sooryen was quickly able to deploy cutting BI technologies like Tableau (for visualization) and SAS (for analytics), putting the best available BI in the hands of decision makers at 1-800-Flowers.com.</p>
