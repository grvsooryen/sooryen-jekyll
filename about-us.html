               Söoryen was founded with the intent to make people happy. Our employees, our customers and our community! This job is easier said than done. Happiness means different things to different people. This is what gets us motivated, helps us keep going and serves as a guiding beacon. We have grown from our home office roots to a global footprint of 5 offices and over a 100 associates with this core value. Our challenges will be numerous and there will be some steep hills to climb but the one thing that we vow not to lose sight of is the pursuit of happiness.
<br><br>SHINE.

                            <p>I've been working at Söoryen Technologies as a full-time developer for more than 3 years, and it's still a great place to work for -- unlimited and flexible time off policies -- very diverse group of people with lots of variety in skill and personality. Söoryen is a great place to grow your knowledge and experiences. There are a lot of learning materials and skillful co-workers that have endlessly improve my skills. Very often, I have been pushed out of my comfort zone to go above and beyond my capabilities in order to learn new technologies. This was tough at first, but because of it, I’ve been able to really expand my skills and feel proud of the work I do.</p>

                        <p>I started working at Söoryen as the first employee from the India team in 2013. As a part of the Söoryen team, I get to utilize my talents in an atmosphere that challenges me every day and helps me offer the best services to our clients. What I like most about Söoryen is the amazing culture of open communication where everyone's ideas matter and we tackle work as a team, supporting each other in everything we do. At the end of the day, I leave work feeling fulfilled, like I made a real impact on our clients.</p>

                        <p>I have been at Söoryen for a bit more than a year now and everyone who works here makes it so great to come into work everyday. Not long after I started working here it felt like I was at home with family. The Söoryen office has a very comfortable, upbeat environment. There’s never a dull moment and always plenty of laughter. Söoryen gives its employees the opportunity to grow and learn, always pushing you past your limit to get the best out of you.</p>
