			<h2>Problem</h2>
			<p>When Oriental Trading Company began rapidly gaining mobile customers, they were unable to provide the well-optimized experience mobile users have come to expect. Their previous mobile system posed more problems than solutions. It was inflexible and blocked rapid, timely changes. There was no way to implement separate analytics for mobile and desktop websites. The mobile site was costly to maintain and its design did not reflect the modern look of current web interfaces.</p>
