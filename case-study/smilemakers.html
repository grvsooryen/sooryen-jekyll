			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The existing SmileMakers e-commerce site was built on a technology platform that had been bought out by a different company, and support and maintenance were now key concerns for SmileMakers. To mitigate this, SmileMakers approached Sooryen Technologies to select a new e-commerce platform and migrate their entire e-commerce site to the new platform.</p>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>The team at Sooryen quickly went to work on developing the front end for the SmileMakers ecommerce platform. Our team decided that the most optimal platform for this transition was going to be the latest version of Magento. Our team worked with SmileMakers designers throughout the process as we rebuilt and migrated them onto their now Magento platform, making it a smooth seamless transition. The major enhancements on the front end side included improved search capabilities, an advanced navigation bar and a mobile responsive design for a cross functional ecommerce site. The biggest challenge while migrating SmileMakers to their new platform came from integrations at the backend. The difficulty in this lay mostly with the fact that we had to get the backend customizations to integrate with their existing Customer Order Management system. So implementing EDI for customers, orders and products was initially a bit tricky, however the team was able to solve this problem and the site now runs smoothly with an edgy new look and feel to it.</p>
