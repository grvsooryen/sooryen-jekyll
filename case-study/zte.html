		<h2>Problem</h2>
		<p>SÃ¶oryen Technologies was approached by ZTE USA to redesign their current Magento platform just months before the release of their new phone, Axon. The platform that was currently in place was in need of an overhaul, it was out dated, laggy and did not have a modern user interface.
		<br> <br> 
		With a month and a half time deadline, our task was to create a user friendly interface for both desktop and mobile, while providing a new cutting edge look to represent their innovative technologies.

		<h2>Solution</h2>
		<p>Our team of designers went to work to create a platform driven entirely by Magento. Once their current system was brought over to the new Magento platform a new theme was in order. Our designers worked closely with ZTE to create a custom theme reflecting the innovative and sleek designs of their technologies. PayPal and other third party payment options were implemented for a more user friendly experience. Designers worked around the clock to ensure the site was optimized on both desktop and mobile platforms in the short time frame allotted. </p>
