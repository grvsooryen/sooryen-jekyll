    title: TESTIMONIALS
    devname1: Rob Chojnacki
    designation1: Tech Lead
    about1: Having been one of the first employees that Ram hired, I've had the unique
      opportunity to not only watch the company grow, but to watch my skills grow
      with the company. The person I was when I started here could not have imagined
      the person I am today. That wouldn't have happened at a lot of places, but it's
      almost guaranteed to happen here at Sooryen.
    devname2: Chris Mucyo
    designation2: Software Developer
    about2: The thing I like the most about Sooryen Technologies is the culture. Working
      for Sooryen means working in a fun, friendly and multicultural environment while
      also staying professional. Since I got here in 2015, the great coworkers and
      leadership have enabled me to learn something new every day and they have also
      helped me improve as a person.
    devname3: Meha Shah
    designation3: Software Developer
    about3: I've been working at Söoryen for over 3 years now. The best part of working
      at Söoryen is its encouraging environment and friendly 'work hard, play hard'
      culture. With great people to work with and very approachable management, they
      are always open to new ideas. The company's growth and my growth have gone hand
      in hand, so it feels like a second home to me. I'm looking forward to many more
      future years at Söoryen.
    devname4: Anthony Aliano
    designation4: Designer
    about4: I started at Söoryen nearly two years ago, and I have had nothing less
      than amazing experiences the entire time. The past few years have offered me
      not only opportunities, but also challenges to learn and grow as a designer,
      and push me outside my comfort zone allowing me to rise to the challenge. Söoryen
      has been the place where the office feels less like “the office” and more like
      a second home, with the people around you being less your “coworkers” and more
      your close friends.
