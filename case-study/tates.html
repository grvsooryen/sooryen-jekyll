						<p>Tate’s Bake Shop sells homemade baked goods that are delivered right to the customer’s door. Tate’s wanted to rebrand online and improve overall user experience. A new ordering system was needed to accommodate multiple purchases made by a single buyer. </p>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>Tate’s was on a legacy ecommerce platform with a traditional design that lacked sophisticated user functions. Sooryen evaluated Tate’s existing website as well as gained insight into business processes that Tate’s needed. It was decided that a fully customized Magento ecommerce platform was the right solution for the job.</p>

			<h2>Implementation</h2>
			<p>Sooryen took a 360&#176; approach to Tate’s that began with a recommendation that they reshoot their entire product catalog. Sooryen designed a delivery customization feature so customers could input as many different recipient shipping addresses into their data record as desired. In addition, the feature allowed customers to specify the date when individual packages should be shipped. This delivery specification feature was linked directly to shipping so it automatically calculated total cost to reflect the cost of delivery to different geographic locations. The solution was implemented across desktop, tablets and smartphones devices. A similar method was implemented for corporate customers as well. The corporate ordering process used to be be one in which the order first had to go through many different hands before being submitted for fulfillment, now a company can go directly on tatesbakeshop.com and place their order directly, where discounts and multiple recipients are applied and saved in the database for later use. An add-on feature was also implemented which enables customers to add items not usually found in a particular gift basket or add more of something they like in particular.
